# Testing the Twitter Integration

## Summary

The Twitter/X integration has been successfully implemented and built! Here's what you need to know:

### ‚úÖ Build Status
The project builds successfully with no compilation errors.

### üîß Configuration Required

To run the bot with Twitter posting, you need to set these environment variables:

```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your_api_key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_api_secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_token
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
```

### üß™ Testing in Development Mode

Set `APP_ENVIRONMENT=development` to run in development mode where:
- The bot will log what tweets would be sent without actually posting
- You can verify the format and functionality without using Twitter API quota

### üìù Tweet Format

Sales will be posted in this format:
```
TOKEN_NAME (#ID) sold for PRICE ETH ($USD_PRICE USD)!
```

Example:
```
Wizard #1234 sold for 0.5 ETH ($925.50 USD)!
```

### üöÄ How It Works

1. **Sales Detection**: The bot checks for new sales every minute (configurable)
2. **Discord Post**: Posts the sale to configured Discord channels (existing functionality)
3. **Twitter Post**: Also posts the same sale to Twitter/X (new functionality)
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Uses Redis caching to prevent posting the same sale twice

### üîç What to Look For in Logs

When running, you should see:
- `Running Sales Checker Job` - The cron job is checking for sales
- `Posting sale to Twitter: [cacheKey]` - A sale is being posted to Twitter
- `[DEV MODE] Would tweet: [message]` - Development mode showing what would be tweeted
- `Successfully tweeted: [id] - [message]` - Production mode successful post

### üéØ Next Steps

1. Ensure all required environment variables are set
2. Run the application: `yarn start:dev` or `yarn start:prod`
3. Monitor the logs to see sales being posted
4. Check your Twitter account for the posted tweets (in production mode)

The integration is complete and ready to use!
